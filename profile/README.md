##GitHub Copilot Enterprise for Eclipse Committers

This GitHub organization is a placeholder used to grant committers on Eclipse Foundation projects free access to GitHub Copilot Enterprise. See the [full announcement](LINK TO BLOG POST).

Eligible committers can opt in via their Eclipse Foundation [account page](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/edit), under the GitHub-related settings. Once opted in, they will receive an invitation to this organization. After accepting the invitation, GitHub Copilot Enterprise will be enabled for all of their work on GitHub.

If a committer later chooses to leave the program, they can simply opt out from the same Eclipse Foundation [account page](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/edit). They will then be removed from this organization, and their access to GitHub Copilot Enterprise will be revoked accordingly.
